### Code In Your Plate

##### Recipe Webpage: Spaghetti Bolognese


I have worked on two recipe projects for the unit. The first is a webpage using HTML & CSS to make a responsive webpage of a Spaghetti Bolognese Recipe found online. This helped me to get familiar with the basics of coding and experiment with responsive design.

##### The Union Hack

The second is a recipe search website that displays information from an API. This has been styled using CSS and jQuery to get the information from the API to display when searched.

##### Paper Wireframeing

In the initial stages of the development, I created paper wireframes which allowed me to put down on paper, the ideas of the website into what would be the basic tempting of the site. This allowed me to get all of the ideas such as features and the feel of the website presented visually in a way that I can see if it looks appealing and follows convention and web trends and appeals to the user.

##### Eyebombing


After Feedback from my Paper Wire framing, I then created my digital wireframes of Moqups. These allowed for me to experiment with layouts popular within web design and start mapping content on the page in further detail. I also created links between the pages which was presented during my formative presentation.

### Formative Presentation

I presented the progress of my development with the wire-framing and planning process and also with the recipe development on the 9th March 2015.

### Live Website


The website is hosted on the Raveweb.net server running Wordpress in the backend as a content management system (CMS). 

The website is online and available **[here](http://harryseaton.raveweb.net/)**.


##### Front-End Code

The website has been coded in HTML & CSS, then implemented into the LearnPress Wordpress theme using php page templates. 

*Page Source Codes:*


- [Header](https://github.com/TomSharmanWeb/HarrySeatonWebsite/blob/master/Website/header.php)
- [Home Page](https://github.com/TomSharmanWeb/HarrySeatonWebsite/blob/master/Website/page-home.php)
- [Tickets Page](https://github.com/TomSharmanWeb/HarrySeatonWebsite/blob/master/Website/page-tickets.php)
- [Watch Page](https://github.com/TomSharmanWeb/HarrySeatonWebsite/blob/master/Website/page-watch.php)
- [Connect Page](https://github.com/TomSharmanWeb/HarrySeatonWebsite/blob/master/Website/page-connect.php)
- [LookBook Page](https://github.com/TomSharmanWeb/HarrySeatonWebsite/blob/master/Website/page-lookbook.php)
- [Terms Page](https://github.com/TomSharmanWeb/HarrySeatonWebsite/blob/master/Website/page-terms.php)
- [404 Page](https://github.com/TomSharmanWeb/HarrySeatonWebsite/blob/master/Website/templates/404.php)
- [Footer](https://github.com/TomSharmanWeb/HarrySeatonWebsite/blob/master/Website/footer.php)




##### Back-End Code

I have also Implemented some php functions and jQuery Functions into the website so add features such as the video player, the sound for the homepage video and the LookBook masonry.

- [Masonry jQuery Code](https://github.com/TomSharmanWeb/HarrySeatonWebsite/blob/master/Website/js/masonry.js)
- [HomePage Video Sound jQuery Code](https://github.com/TomSharmanWeb/HarrySeatonWebsite/blob/master/Website/js/homevid.js)


##### Implementation with Wordpress as CMS

The static HTML files were converted into a php Wordpress theme, LearnPress. This gave the very basic structure of a wordpress theme and I implemented the code into a php file for each page. The header and footer code was then added to the header.php and footer.php.


Here is an image of the WP Dashboard for the live website:
![image](https://github.com/TomSharmanWeb/HarrySeatonWebsite/blob/master/Miscellaneous/liveWebsiteWPDashboard.png)


The Plugins used were Advanced Custom Fields, Advanced Custom Fields Rpeater and Migrate Sync DB. Advanced Custom Fields allowed for fields to be added to the site in which the site admin could easily change content, and using php implemented into the code, would change the pages content. The Migrate Sync DB plugin synchronised the databases from the local Wordpress to the Remote Wordpress (The Live website).


Here is an image of the Plugins used on Wordpress:

##### CSS

The website has been styled in CSS using the Skeleton CSS Boilerplate and then custom CSS (main.css). This has been overwritten of the skeleton CSS files to style the website.

### Summative Presentation


I presented the Summative Presentation via Video on Friday 12th June 2015 due to being unable to attend the lecture. It gave me an opportunity to present the project and explain the process in which I took to complete the development. I explained the complications that occurred and how I met the aims that myself and the client initially set during the start of the unit.
